Mathematical models serve as vital computational tools in exploring infectious diseases across various scales, from population dynamics to within-host phenomena. At the within-host level, these models meticulously delineate viral replication, clearance, and immune responses within individual hosts. However, they fall short in directly assessing the population-level impact of detailed individual response to infection. On the contrary, between-host models are extensively employed to delineate transmission dynamics between individuals, study disease epidemiology, and evaluate intervention strategies at a broader scale. Nonetheless, between-host models lack the granularity to account for individual-level biological processes.

In our laboratory, we not only delve into within-host responses for scientific exploration but also bridge the gap between individual and population scales, leveraging cutting-edge biological insights to inform bedside practice and societal strategies through integrative mathematical modeling. This multiscale approach to infectious disease modeling promises a holistic understanding of disease dynamics, offering avenues to simulate the impact of targeted interventions across different population strata.

Research project: Patient stratification for development of better isolation guideline

Isolation of COVID-19 has been implemented in most countries since the pandemic started. However, the isolation guideline varies between countries. Scientifically evidenced isolation guidelines are needed. In this study, we compare different isolation guidelines, using the simulator mimicking the time course change in viral load. This project is led by Keisuke Ejima, an Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University.

Requirements: Candidates should have a Bachelor's degree in a quantitative field, such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field. Research experience and/or educational background on public health and medicine is a plus but not essential. Computational experience on R is preferred.

A good education is one that inspires curiosity, creativity, and community. Our software enables that through visual content creation and collaboration in millions of classrooms worldwide.

We are looking for a Senior Data Scientist to help us make better product designs using the power of data and help us achieve our vision.

Responsibilities


Look at data to discover insights for making the product better, growing product usage, and growing sales.
Whatever else a good data scientist does.


Qualifications


At some point in your life, someone has told you: “you are good with data.”
Track record of improving products with data.
Bonus: you have a good sense of humor.


About Padlet


Vision: Every child in the world will grow up with Mickey Mouse and Padlet.
Product: We are making the default way of collecting and sharing thoughts on the Internet. People love the product.
Impact: We have over 50 million active users making Padlet one of the most used apps on the planet. Our goal is to be THE the most used app on the planet.
Money: We are venture backed AND fiscally responsible. We are built to last one hundred years.
Badassery: We are 36 people (plus a baby crane that we've adopted but it doesn't really do much). That's over a million active users per employee. Some badass people work here.


Joys of Data Science at Padlet


We don't look at data much. (We recognize the value.) There's likely a lot of low hanging fruit. Lots of easy wins.
We have very few meetings. We value keeping you in flow.
A lot of people use Padlet. There is a lot of data to look at.


Sorrows of Data Science at Padlet


We haven't looked at data much and it hasn't traditionally been part of decision making. CEO isn't a decision by data person. There maybe inertia to get your insights into the product.


Some people you‘d be working with


Linh Nguyen: At any given point, no one really knows where Linh is. We learn of his existence through pull requests and code reviews. Frontend maestro.
Brian Koh: Only human we know who has impulsive urges to exercise. When he does, he doesn't care about outfits. We've seen him running in boots, tight jeans, and leather jackets. Exceptional engineer and even better mentor.


Benefits


Top tier medical insurance for you and your family.
Good stock options.
Catered lunches and dinners.
20 vacation days. Plus sickness and bereavement days for when life happens.
All the gadgetry you need, including a new phone every year.


Special time to join

Because we're small, there's a lot of energy. And because we have tremendous traction, your first commit touches millions. This combination is rare and quite satisfying.
