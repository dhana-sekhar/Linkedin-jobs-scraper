Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, 2 Hour Learning. Have you got what it takes?

Are you a skilled full-stack developer with a passion for AI and a drive to transform K-12 education? At 2 Hour Learning, we're leading a revolution in digital learning backed by data and innovation.

At 2 Hour Learning, we don't just aim to improve education—we're redefining it. Our cutting-edge learning ecosystem, powered by advanced AI, learning science, and psychometrics, is twice as effective as traditional schooling. Students at every level, from kindergarten to high school, are achieving remarkable academic milestones, far surpassing standard expectations.

Your Role in the Revolution:

In this role, you’ll be at the forefront of our AI-powered educational transformation. With full autonomy and creative freedom, you’ll envision, develop, and deploy sophisticated full-stack applications and interactive AI tools that not only engage students but also enhance learning efficiency in unprecedented ways.

This is not a position for those who prefer to specialize in a single aspect of development. We're looking for innovative thinkers who can seamlessly integrate AI across both front-end and back-end systems, taking ownership of the entire product. Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology.

Who We're Looking For:

We need bold innovators who thrive on leveraging the latest in generative AI to create real-world educational impact. If you’re excited about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI-driven education and are ready to bring your expertise in full-stack development and AI, this is your chance to make a difference.

What You Will Be Doing


Develop AI-Powered Web Applications: Architect and code sophisticated web applications that integrate both front-end and back-end components, with a focus on enhancing user experience through AI.
Experiment and Innovate with AI: Work with cutting-edge AI technologies, specifically large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or Claude, to create autonomous tools and interactive features that redefine how students learn.

Continuous Improvement: Stay ahead of the curve by continually learning and applying the latest advancements in AI and web development to our platform.


What You Won’t Be Doing


Narrow AI Development: You won’t be working on isolated AI features that don’t integrate with the overall product strategy. Your work will have a direct impact on thousands of students.
Surface-Level Coding: This is not a role for those who focus only on either front-end or back-end development. You will be expected to integrate both, creating comprehensive and scalable solutions.
Routine Maintenance: This role is not about maintaining legacy systems or making minor updates. You will be driving innovation and building new, cutting-edge applications.
Waiting for Detailed Specifications: You won't be handed fully fleshed-out requirements. Instead, you will take high-level ideas and translate them into fully developed products, leveraging your expertise in AI and full-stack development.
Working in Isolation: You won't be coding in a vacuum. Collaboration with other developers, product managers, and educational experts is key to ensuring that the solutions you build are impactful and user-centered.


Artificial Intelligence Engineer Key Responsibilities

Develop and deliver engaging, human-centered AI applications that demonstrably accelerate learning outcomes and efficiency for thousands of K-12 students.

At Auror, we're empowering the retail industry to tackle theft and Organised Retail Crime, a $150 Billion problem globally. It's high volume crime that's increasingly organised in nature and is putting people, retailers, and communities at risk every day.

Founded in New Zealand 11 years ago, we're working with some of the best and largest retailers in the world across the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK.

Auror is connecting people and intelligence to reduce crime. We're using technology for good.

In partnership with our leading retail partners, we need people with the passion, determination, and innovation required to overcome one of the world's largest problems. If you're looking to make a difference with and for the people dedicated to stopping crime, for good, then we want you on our team.

The Role

We are looking for a Data Engineer who is eager to work with a modern data platform as part of our data engineering team. The team is part of the wider Data and AI team, which are based all over the world. However, our core team is based in Auckland, New Zealand, and this role is based in our Auckland HQ.

Our data engineers typically work on data pipelines and transformations - moving data from core data stores to our data warehouse, and transforming it into concise, clean, and useful views. We have many sources of data, some examples are: a relational (Azure SQL) database of retail crime reports, high frequency detections of vehicles from automated license plate recognition (LPR) cameras (stored in CosmosDB), and high frequency click-events from users interacting with our platform (stored in Blob Store). Our team uses tools such as DBT, Airflow, Azure Functions, Fivetran and Azure Data Factory to move data around in our platform, typically landing it in our data warehouse (Snowflake) before it is consumed by our platform and customers. We also use tools such as Python and Snowpark to transform our data.

Your role would be diverse, gaining experience across our entire data platform. Initially your time would be spent getting familiar with our core data systems, before moving on to building out new data pipelines and transformations. This role is focused on both the engineering side of data engineering and the people side. We expect you to be spending most of your time building scalable pipelines and working on our data infrastructure, as well as communicating and collaborating with various teams across Auror. As a senior data engineer we'd expect you to be able to teach our more junior engineers on best practices in order to help them improve their craft.

What you will work on:


Distributing scalable data pipelines using infrastructure-as-code and CI/CD processes
Working collaboratively with the wider Auror team to help generate robust data models that can be used in a variety of applications
Continuously improving our core systems with a focus on data quality and observability
Investigating new and exciting tools that may help to improve our data processes
Your time would be split 50/50 working collaboratively within the Data Team and working as part of our product streams. The product streams include a product manager, software engineers, QA and design



This role reports to Nickolas Morton, Lead Data Engineer

LinkedIn Link

I joined Auror because I wanted to work on something that mattered. I currently sit within the data team and mostly work with our data warehouse and its use within the company. At university I studied complex network theory, which then transitioned into data science. I quickly understood that in order to provide quality, production ready insights the data platform itself has to be robust. This led me into data engineering, where I have found my passion. I enjoy working with people who care about what they do, and are always keen to experiment and improve.

Requirements

About you

What you need to know:


Experience working with Microsoft Azure or another cloud provider in a production environment
Understanding of Git and CI/CD best practices
Experience with writing infrastructure as code (IaC)
Strong skills in Python and SQL
Experience creating distributed pipelines for shifting data at scale
Experience dockerising and deploying code projects, such as data science models



Nice to have:


Experience or projects using DBT and some database (such as Azure SQL, Postgres or Snowflake)
Experience writing IaC using Pulumi
Experience with Snowflake
Experience with a graph database, such as Neo4j
Experience with data patterns, such as: data lakes, data mesh, medallion architecture, etc
Familiarity with an agile workflows


We are looking for people who demonstrate a strong alignment to our Guiding Principles (you can find these on our Careers page).

Auror is committed to providing an inclusive and accessible application process to all candidates and we are actively working to improve diversity within the tech industry. We celebrate diversity and inclusiveness at Auror, regardless of (but not limited to) race, gender, sexual orientation, family status, religion, ethnicity, national origin, physical disability, veteran status, or age.

If you need adjustments to any part of our recruitment process because of accessibility reasons, please do not hesitate to let us know during the application process. We will work with you to identify adjustments that will allow you to perform at your best.

Benefits


Competitive salary Range: Depending on level of experience of $115,000-155,000NZD (IC3)
Employee share scheme: You'll own part of a company making a real difference!
Flexibility: We are hard-working and outcome focused, but recognise there is more to life than work. We promote a healthy work/life blend
Shorter work weeks (at full pay): Everyone gets Friday afternoons off, so you can start your weekend early, and do more of whatever it is that makes you happy
Focus on mental and physical health: We understand how vital our health is and have policies to support your wellness, including: Wellness Days, and up to three expert sessions paid for every year

Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.

Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, 你好, hallo, vítejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

Where And How You Can Work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work, we trust our Canvanauts to choose the balance that empowers them and their team to achieve their goals.

What You’d Be Doing In This Role

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

At The Moment, This Role Is Focused On


Shaping the crucial ML and Python specialty roadmap for the group, leveraging a strong product/platform mindset. Your role will be pivotal in defining the investment needed to elevate Python support and close the existing capability gaps.
Architecting, building and delivering solutions to improve the Python and ML engineering experience at Canva, ensuring high standards of engineering excellence.
Developing advanced tooling and metrics to enable both our team and platform users to understand and respond to the health of our systems.
Developing and maintaining comprehensive documentation, establishing best practices and guidelines for Python and ML engineering.
Mentoring and guiding other engineers, playing a key role in their professional growth and development, fostering a culture of continuous learning and development.
Influencing and advocating for engineering best practices across the organization, ensuring alignment with Canva’s long-term strategic goals.
Leading solution design meetings, participating in hiring interviews, and code reviews.



You're probably a match if


You have demonstrated leadership and ownership over complex, high-impact problems and their solutions, with a strong sense of accountability.
You're passionate about engineering excellence, systems architecture, and meeting non-functional requirements.
You have a proven track record of fostering team collaboration and driving collective success through shared challenges and goals.
You have deep expertise in Python development is essential, with experience in modern development tools such as Bazel or Nix being a plus.
You have extensive experience with containerization, Terraform, and GitOps principles for automation and deployment.
You have a strong background in ML concepts and applications, with a proven ability to integrate ML capabilities into existing infrastructure, and in-depth knowledge of MLOps best practices.
You're proficient with ML frameworks such as pandas, NumPy, PyTorch, Ray, and TensorRT is highly desirable. Hands-on experience with CUDA as a platform operator is a significant advantage.
You have a proven track record of leading and executing large-scale engineering projects, showcasing an ability to handle increased scope and complexity compared to a similar senior role.



About The Team

You'll be joining the Language Ecosystem team, whose mission is to uplift language and ecosystem support across Developer Platform products. Working directly with teams across the group, your role will focus on enhancing support for specific language-related workflows and delivering solutions that eliminate capability gaps.

As Canva continues to invest in ML, there is a growing need to bridge the gap between the experience of our ML Engineers and that of our frontend and backend engineers. Python is the language of choice in the AI/ML space. However, our current developer experience has been primarily focused on TypeScript (frontend) and Java (backend), leading to challenges with Python support. Currently, the AI Platform teams have built some key capabilities, but further investment in Platform Engineering teams is required to elevate Python support to be on par with Java and TypeScript. This investment will enable AI Platform to concentrate on AI-specific capabilities while the Platform Engineering teams enhance the overall Python experience.

The ML Parity program outlines a staged approach to incrementally invest in Python-based ML-serving technologies, empowering our ML engineers and applied scientists to leverage all Canva platforms effectively. This role is essential in driving this transition and ensuring Python becomes a first-class citizen at Canva.

As a Python Specialist on the Language Ecosystem team, you'll:


Lead and own collaborations with engineers across the organization to understand their requirements and design platform infrastructure solutions with a strong emphasis on Python.
Partner with Developer Platform product managers and leadership to define and drive strategic priorities and the roadmap for ML and Python-related initiatives within the team.
Take full ownership of high-impact projects aimed at uplifting the Python and ML local development experience, ensuring timely and effective delivery.
Spearhead innovation in Python and ML engineering practices and development experience, setting the standard for a unified and resilient infrastructure.
Serve as the primary point of contact for Python-related inquiries and challenges within the Developer Platform team, providing expert guidance and solutions.



What's in it for you?

Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a range of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.

Here's a Taste Of What's On Offer


Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too
Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers
An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more
Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally

Other Stuff To Know

We make hiring decisions based on your experience, skills and passion, as well as how you can enhance Canva and our culture. When you apply, please tell us the pronouns you use and any reasonable adjustments you may need during the interview process.

We celebrate all types of skills and backgrounds at Canva so even if you don’t feel like your skills quite match what’s listed above - we still want to hear from you!
