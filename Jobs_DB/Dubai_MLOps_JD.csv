Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation and IoT. Our customers include the world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1000+ colleagues in 70+ countries and very few roles based in offices.

The company is founder led, profitable and growing. We are hiring an Cloud Solutions Architect in our Alliances team to help our biggest partners (companies like Intel, Nvidia, Google, Dell, HP, Accenture, Tata and the like) understand and embrace our open source platform for themselves and their customers.

Our worldwide field engineering team apply expert insights to real-world customer problems, enabling the enterprise adoption of Ubuntu, OpenStack, Kubernetes, AI/MLOps and a wide range of associated technologies. We are experts in the whole open source stack, from kernel to desktop, from cloud to the edge. Our team is also interested in business problems - building things reliably, efficiently and cost-effectively, and we have to learn to speak the language of our customers and their industries.

We help global companies embrace public and private cloud infrastructure, cloud native operations, and open source applications. For this team we are looking for several Alliances Engineers to support OEM (hardware manufacturers), GSI (global system integrators), ISV (independent software vendors), Channel partners and Public Cloud alliance partners. You will support various alliances and partners of Canonical to adopt our products and technologies, help business leaders to define joint go-to-market programs with partners from the technical standpoint.

We often say that our field engineers have 'the hardest job at Canonical' because customers can ask about any aspect of our solutions and products and expect a thoughtful, well-informed answer.
