Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, 2 Hour Learning. Have you got what it takes?

Are you a skilled full-stack developer with a passion for AI and a drive to transform K-12 education? At 2 Hour Learning, we're leading a revolution in digital learning backed by data and innovation.

At 2 Hour Learning, we don't just aim to improve education—we're redefining it. Our cutting-edge learning ecosystem, powered by advanced AI, learning science, and psychometrics, is twice as effective as traditional schooling. Students at every level, from kindergarten to high school, are achieving remarkable academic milestones, far surpassing standard expectations.

Your Role in the Revolution:

In this role, you’ll be at the forefront of our AI-powered educational transformation. With full autonomy and creative freedom, you’ll envision, develop, and deploy sophisticated full-stack applications and interactive AI tools that not only engage students but also enhance learning efficiency in unprecedented ways.

This is not a position for those who prefer to specialize in a single aspect of development. We're looking for innovative thinkers who can seamlessly integrate AI across both front-end and back-end systems, taking ownership of the entire product. Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology.

Who We're Looking For:

We need bold innovators who thrive on leveraging the latest in generative AI to create real-world educational impact. If you’re excited about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI-driven education and are ready to bring your expertise in full-stack development and AI, this is your chance to make a difference.

What You Will Be Doing


Develop AI-Powered Web Applications: Architect and code sophisticated web applications that integrate both front-end and back-end components, with a focus on enhancing user experience through AI.
Experiment and Innovate with AI: Work with cutting-edge AI technologies, specifically large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or Claude, to create autonomous tools and interactive features that redefine how students learn.
Drive Technical Projects: Take ownership of the entire development process, from gathering requirements to launching and iterating on products. You’ll work closely with stakeholders to ensure that our solutions meet learner needs and push the boundaries of what’s possible.
Collaborate and Communicate: Partner with a global team of developers, designers, and educational experts. Your ability to communicate complex ideas simply and effectively will be key to your success.
Continuous Improvement: Stay ahead of the curve by continually learning and applying the latest advancements in AI and web development to our platform.


What You Won’t Be Doing


Narrow AI Development: You won’t be working on isolated AI features that don’t integrate with the overall product strategy. Your work will have a direct impact on thousands of students.
Surface-Level Coding: This is not a role for those who focus only on either front-end or back-end development. You will be expected to integrate both, creating comprehensive and scalable solutions.
Routine Maintenance: This role is not about maintaining legacy systems or making minor updates. You will be driving innovation and building new, cutting-edge applications.
Waiting for Detailed Specifications: You won't be handed fully fleshed-out requirements. Instead, you will take high-level ideas and translate them into fully developed products, leveraging your expertise in AI and full-stack development.
Working in Isolation: You won't be coding in a vacuum. Collaboration with other developers, product managers, and educational experts is key to ensuring that the solutions you build are impactful and user-centered.


Artificial Intelligence Engineer Key Responsibilities

Develop and deliver engaging, human-centered AI applications that demonstrably accelerate learning outcomes and efficiency for thousands of K-12 students.

Basic Requirements


At least 3 years of experience in full-stack development, with proficiency in front-end frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue.js, or Svelte, and back-end technologies like Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, Flask, or Spring Boot.
Hands-on experience integrating large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude, or similar into web applications.
Proven ability to independently manage and execute technical projects from start to finish, including gathering requirements, development, deployment, and iteration.
Excellent verbal and written communication skills, with the ability to collaborate effectively with stakeholders, team members, and users across a global, remote team.
A demonstrated passion for staying at the forefront of technology, particularly in AI and web development, with a commitment to continuous learning and applying new advancements to your work.

Flip sits at the heart of the logistics ecosystem, enabling senders and carriers to operate, disrupt and grow in powerful and effective ways.

We harness the power of product, engineering and customer-centric design to build high quality, elegant solutions that we are proud of and our customers love to use.

We are made up of a bunch of curious technologists bringing a fresh perspective to modernising the logistics industry. We thrive on solving the hardest problems and this is reflected in our culture which encourages us to create, experiment and collaborate with our customers.

As an established, profitable and growing company we take our responsibilities to our customers seriously as we continue to build upon our data-driven platform to create a new ecosystem of integrated logistics.

We work flexibly with 4 days a week remote and 2 days working together in front of whiteboards in our CBD office.

What does this role require?

You will need a real commitment to working with customers and product people to deliver well engineered solutions that you are proud of, which are a joy to inherit, maintain and extend.

This role requires excellent cross functional collaboration and project management skills and experience with a focus on helping to ensure the right outcomes at the right time are being delivered.

You are an experienced team builder and an excellent coach to both individual contributors and team leaders.

You will be helping to deliver and extend a customer facing platform that within an interesting, complex, and highly unstructured domain - logistics and transportation. Your focus will be on team work and engineering excellence across the front and back end of this platform.

You will also need to be able to guide decisions around system and software design reasoning with an open mind, based on customer, engineering, and product considerations.

You will be working with customers, stakeholders, product and design teams ensuring cross functional cohesion and collaboration.

You are excited to imagine future strategic outcomes, and then turn that into action and results.

Who will I be working with?

You will work closely with the CEO to ensure the company mission, vision, culture, and strategy are effectively and consistently shared across your teams.

You will enjoy the company of a strong product team and together you will discover and unpack the needs, goals and frustrations of our customers in order to deliver high quality and valuable solutions that we are proud of and they love to use.

Each of your engineering teams have an amazing team lead and highly skilled and engaged Senior and Mid level Engineers. Each with an architectural understanding of building software. This has been important due to the complexities of new and existing software.

You will find the conversations you have are underpinned by deep levels of technical knowledge, curiosity, domain knowledge and a satisfaction of learning with other growth mindset people.

Can you tell me about the leadership?

Leadership largely resides in existing Engineers, Designers, and Leads.You will also find a very experienced technical CTO/CEO that facilitates this mindset and works on an equal footing with everyone, although naturally, with a commercial aspect to their role.

Company leadership listens closely and acts on the sentiment of both customers and technology whilst looking after business direction and commercial success.

How are things organised?

You will have three team leaders as direct reports with around 5 Engineers in turn reporting to them. One front end and two back end engineering teams. We are a lean shop that practises scrumban.

In addition our Geek4Geek will report to you. This person focuses on Kaizen, infrastructure, security, and compliance - they serve the overall engineering team and lend a hand where it is needed.

Who makes technical decisions?

Engineers do this together with the guidance of team leads and the engineering manager. You're empowered not only to step up to lead, but to also step up to follow: You won't be forced to accept things the way they are, but you will need the insight and maturity to determine when best to have backbone, or when to disagree with and then commit to the team.

Why would I apply?


You love ambiguous, large, complex domains coupled with a mission and empowerment to simplify and take real ownership and responsibility to deliver engineering excellence
You might be looking for a mature and respectful environment with a high level of technical competence that is self organising
You might be after an uncomplicated and transparent hiring process. One technical conversation, one product, and one team fit/leadership. There will be technical and leadership discussions where hopefully you will feel challenged yet supported
You might be after a flexible work environment. Whilst this is not a remote role, you might enjoy a day or three working from home each week. Or you may not be a morning person. No stress
Generous salary



Why might I not apply?


You might prefer an environment where you get to make solo decisions without collaboration or care for others. If so then this role will probably not be a good fit. You will need a creative, tenacious and collaborative approach to creating solutions and be able to comfortably communicate your thoughts whilst listening to those you work with
You might be looking for a more traditional ""management"" role with direct reports under you that blindly follow your every whim. We have a flat culture and everyone is a leader, not always in the people management sense though



Requirements

What is the technology and what processes are used?

Hiring is not made purely on the basis of specific languages and tooling but as a guide the following skills would be useful:


We try to follow lean principles more than an Agile™ - mainly scrumban
Serverless as an engineering first principle, containers second, and everything else is considered on a case by case basis
Linux, AWS
Distributed Computing: Event Sourcing and CQRS as one of the core patterns in use
Transparent, honest, and blameless communication with high levels of individual accountability



Benefits

Flexible work arrangements.

$1,000 per annum to spend on professional development.

No agency canvassing.

At Aphex (https://www.aphex.co/), we believe that construction teams shouldn't have to plan with software that should have stayed in 1995.

That's why we are on a mission to make it easier for construction teams to get on the same page with a live, multiplayer planning platform. Instead of a mountain of spreadsheets, whiteboards, and stone tablets, our platform allows anyone on a project to plan and communicate their work with complete visibility of everything happening around them.

Our customers are the largest construction contractors that build the tunnels, roads, bridges and buildings we use daily. Our fantastic users are the engineers managing and planning these great projects.

We're at an exciting stage of our journey. Having launched our V1 in the UK in 2019, we are now the platform that the largest projects and contractors in the UK and Australia are powered by. As we move from the product/market fit phase of our journey to larger and larger user and customer adoption, we are continuing to grow our team.

This is an awesome opportunity for someone who may not have buckets of experience, but are keen to get stuck in & learn as they go. You'll be joining our Customer Experience team based in Brisbane & our wider team are remote across London, Wales, Melbourne and the Philippines.

Join us on a mission to improve an industry that contributes to around 10% of GDP but is less productive than 20 years ago... It's kind of a big issue.

The role

Solving problems in live chat
Investigating and reproducing bugs
Testing an upcoming feature release


As a product-led team with a deep focus on user engagement, you will find yourself at the heart of Aphex, learning rapidly about construction, software development, and building beautiful products that help infrastructure projects happen.

Beyond that, joining the team now will give you unlimited potential for professional growth - you will have as much responsibility and ownership as you want.

The Customer Experience team works across Brisbane and London, so you can expect to be drawn into working later, 1-3 days a week. However, this timezone spread does allow a high degree of flexibility to your hours.

Requirements

You love to solve problems and help people
You are hungry to learn. Period
You have a growth mindset and can push yourself outside your comfort zone

Who We're Looking For:

What You Won’t Be Doing


Narrow AI Development: You won’t be working on isolated AI features that don’t integrate with the overall product strategy. Your work will have a direct impact on thousands of students.
Surface-Level Coding: This is not a role for those who focus only on either front-end or back-end development. You will be expected to integrate both, creating comprehensive and scalable solutions.
Routine Maintenance: This role is not about maintaining legacy systems or making minor updates. You will be driving innovation and building new, cutting-edge applications.
Waiting for Detailed Specifications: You won't be handed fully fleshed-out requirements. Instead, you will take high-level ideas and translate them into fully developed products, leveraging your expertise in AI and full-stack development.

Quantitative Researcher – Honours and Master’s,"Susquehanna International Group, LLP (SIG)",Australia,2024-08-25,https://au.linkedin.com/jobs/view/quantitative-researcher-%E2%80%93-honours-and-master%E2%80%99s-at-susquehanna-international-group-llp-sig-3812786857?position=6&pageNum=15&refId=V1Ktn7vYgyO0fdGGBVW6Iw%3D%3D&trackingId=6hA7mDSqwuZjKt2op4Zs%2FA%3D%3D&trk=public_jobs_jserp-result_search-card,"Overview

We’re looking for accomplished researchers who are interested in growing their career in the field of quantitative finance. Our Quantitative Researchers apply mathematics, statistics, and programming to solve complex problems found in our trading environment. While the problems we solve at SIG are often different from academia, our problems demand the attention of brilliant minds that have an extraordinary attention to detail and a relentless pursuit of understanding.

What You’ll Do

The general lifecycle of a quant project begins with an idea:


This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
As a Quantitative Researcher, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
You will work side-by-side with technologists in order to backtest your results and put that trading signal into production.
Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will continue to do research on that strategy in order to optimize its performance.
As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.


We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

Read about Robert’s ‘Day in the life’ as a Quantitative Researcher .

What We're Looking For


Honours or Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
Exceptional mathematical problem-solving skills
Solid communication skills, both in the ability to understand others and to make yourself clearly understood
Strong, practical computing skills; a specific language proficiency is less important than your ability to get computers to accomplish tasks efficiently and reliably
Experience working on in-depth research projects
Finance experience is not a requirement


What’s In It For You


Our market leading education program, incorporating classroom theory, simulated learning, and a secondment to our Philadelphia office is renowned to set graduates up for success.
Our non-hierarchical culture allows employees of every level to thrive and have an impact. We are not your typical trading firm – the environment is casual, collaborative and we focus on continuous development.
Highly competitive remuneration, attractive bonus, and additional leave entitlements.
Private healthcare and gym allowances, plus wellness initiatives.
Fully stocked kitchen - daily breakfast and lunch.
Regular social, sporting, and community events.
Visa sponsorship and relocation package where required.

Interview Process

Apply -> Online Assessments -> Recruiter Interview -> Technical Interview -> Final Round Interviews -> Job Offer!

By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Systematic Trader position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.

Equal Opportunity statement

We encourage applications from candidates from all backgrounds, and we welcome requests for reasonable adjustments during the recruitment process to ensure that you can best demonstrate your abilities. If you have any questions, please contact sydneycampus@sig.com .

About SIG

SIG is a global quantitative trading firm founded by a group of friends who share a passion for game theory and probabilistic thinking. We have incorporated this approach into our culture, where you will find relentless problem solvers within each of our core disciplines: Trading, Technology, and Quantitative Research. From offices around the world, our employees collaborate to make optimal decisions and are driven by the desire to achieve winning results together.

We are experts in trading essentially all listed financial products and asset classes, with a focus on derivatives trading. Through market making and market taking, we handle millions of trading transactions around the world every day, providing liquidity and ensuring competitive prices for buyers and sellers. While our presence in the market is broad, our trading desks are highly specialized, allowing for a deep understanding of unique drivers of each asset class.

SIG does not post salary information, so any salary information you find online may not be accurate because it was not provided or verified by SIG.

SIG does not accept unsolicited resumes from recruiters or search firms. Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will become the property of SIG and no fee will be paid.
