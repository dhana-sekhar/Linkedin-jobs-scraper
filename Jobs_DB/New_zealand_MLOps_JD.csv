Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.

Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, 你好, hallo, vítejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

Where And How You Can Work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work, we trust our Canvanauts to choose the balance that empowers them and their team to achieve their goals.

What You’d Be Doing In This Role

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

At The Moment, This Role Is Focused On


Shaping the crucial ML and Python specialty roadmap for the group, leveraging a strong product/platform mindset. Your role will be pivotal in defining the investment needed to elevate Python support and close the existing capability gaps.
Architecting, building and delivering solutions to improve the Python and ML engineering experience at Canva, ensuring high standards of engineering excellence.
Developing advanced tooling and metrics to enable both our team and platform users to understand and respond to the health of our systems.
Developing and maintaining comprehensive documentation, establishing best practices and guidelines for Python and ML engineering.
Mentoring and guiding other engineers, playing a key role in their professional growth and development, fostering a culture of continuous learning and development.
Influencing and advocating for engineering best practices across the organization, ensuring alignment with Canva’s long-term strategic goals.
Leading solution design meetings, participating in hiring interviews, and code reviews.



You're probably a match if


You have demonstrated leadership and ownership over complex, high-impact problems and their solutions, with a strong sense of accountability.
You're passionate about engineering excellence, systems architecture, and meeting non-functional requirements.
You have a proven track record of fostering team collaboration and driving collective success through shared challenges and goals.
You have deep expertise in Python development is essential, with experience in modern development tools such as Bazel or Nix being a plus.
You have extensive experience with containerization, Terraform, and GitOps principles for automation and deployment.
You have a strong background in ML concepts and applications, with a proven ability to integrate ML capabilities into existing infrastructure, and in-depth knowledge of MLOps best practices.
You're proficient with ML frameworks such as pandas, NumPy, PyTorch, Ray, and TensorRT is highly desirable. Hands-on experience with CUDA as a platform operator is a significant advantage.
You have a proven track record of leading and executing large-scale engineering projects, showcasing an ability to handle increased scope and complexity compared to a similar senior role.



About The Team

You'll be joining the Language Ecosystem team, whose mission is to uplift language and ecosystem support across Developer Platform products. Working directly with teams across the group, your role will focus on enhancing support for specific language-related workflows and delivering solutions that eliminate capability gaps.

As Canva continues to invest in ML, there is a growing need to bridge the gap between the experience of our ML Engineers and that of our frontend and backend engineers. Python is the language of choice in the AI/ML space. However, our current developer experience has been primarily focused on TypeScript (frontend) and Java (backend), leading to challenges with Python support. Currently, the AI Platform teams have built some key capabilities, but further investment in Platform Engineering teams is required to elevate Python support to be on par with Java and TypeScript. This investment will enable AI Platform to concentrate on AI-specific capabilities while the Platform Engineering teams enhance the overall Python experience.

The ML Parity program outlines a staged approach to incrementally invest in Python-based ML-serving technologies, empowering our ML engineers and applied scientists to leverage all Canva platforms effectively. This role is essential in driving this transition and ensuring Python becomes a first-class citizen at Canva.

As a Python Specialist on the Language Ecosystem team, you'll:


Lead and own collaborations with engineers across the organization to understand their requirements and design platform infrastructure solutions with a strong emphasis on Python.
Partner with Developer Platform product managers and leadership to define and drive strategic priorities and the roadmap for ML and Python-related initiatives within the team.
Take full ownership of high-impact projects aimed at uplifting the Python and ML local development experience, ensuring timely and effective delivery.
Spearhead innovation in Python and ML engineering practices and development experience, setting the standard for a unified and resilient infrastructure.
Serve as the primary point of contact for Python-related inquiries and challenges within the Developer Platform team, providing expert guidance and solutions.



What's in it for you?

Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a range of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.

Here's a Taste Of What's On Offer


Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too
Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers
An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more
Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally



Check out lifeatcanva.com for more info.

Other Stuff To Know

We make hiring decisions based on your experience, skills and passion, as well as how you can enhance Canva and our culture. When you apply, please tell us the pronouns you use and any reasonable adjustments you may need during the interview process.

We celebrate all types of skills and backgrounds at Canva so even if you don’t feel like your skills quite match what’s listed above - we still want to hear from you!

Please note that interviews are conducted virtually.

Our worldwide field engineering team apply expert insights to real-world customer problems, enabling the enterprise adoption of Ubuntu, OpenStack, Kubernetes, AI/MLOps and a wide range of associated technologies. We are experts in the whole open source stack, from kernel to desktop, from cloud to the edge.

For this team we are looking for several Alliances Engineers to support OEM (hardware manufacturers), GSI (global system integrators), ISV (independent software vendors), Channel partners and Public Cloud alliance partners. You will support various alliances and partners of Canonical to adopt our products and technologies, help business leaders to define joint go-to-market programs with partners from the technical standpoint.

We often say that our field engineers have 'the hardest job at Canonical' because customers can ask about any aspect of our solutions and products and expect a thoughtful, well-informed answer. We always want to do the best thing for our partners and customers, regardless of our company interests, and field engineers are the people we trust to ensure that is true.

Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.

The company is founder led, profitable and growing. We are hiring an Cloud Solutions Architect in our Alliances team to help our biggest partners (companies like Intel, Nvidia, Google, Dell, HP, Accenture, Tata and the like) understand and embrace our open source platform for themselves and their customers.

Our worldwide field engineering team apply expert insights to real-world customer problems, enabling the enterprise adoption of Ubuntu, OpenStack, Kubernetes, AI/MLOps and a wide range of associated technologies. We are experts in the whole open source stack, from kernel to desktop, from cloud to the edge. Our team is also interested in business problems - building things reliably, efficiently and cost-effectively, and we have to learn to speak the language of our customers and their industries.

We help global companies embrace public and private cloud infrastructure, cloud native operations, and open source applications. For this team we are looking for several Alliances Engineers to support OEM (hardware manufacturers), GSI (global system integrators), ISV (independent software vendors), Channel partners and Public Cloud alliance partners. You will support various alliances and partners of Canonical to adopt our products and technologies, help business leaders to define joint go-to-market programs with partners from the technical standpoint.

We often say that our field engineers have 'the hardest job at Canonical' because customers can ask about any aspect of our solutions and products and expect a thoughtful, well-informed answer. We always want to do the best thing for our partners and customers, regardless of our company interests, and field engineers are the people we trust to ensure that is true.

Location: This is a home-based role, we are hiring worldwide.
