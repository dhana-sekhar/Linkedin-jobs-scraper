Mauri Tūhono is a timeless, forever approach to biodiversity across the Wellington Region - a kaupapa pūmau looking beyond ourselves to ensure the protection of te taiao for future mokopuna.

Mauri Tūhono is a kaupapa for everyone, everywhere. It is co-chaired and designed by mana whenua, communities, DOC and supported by the Greater Wellington Regional Council (GWRC).

The framework, named “Kaipupuri Taonga ki te Ao Whānui” is premised upon taiao centric thinking, meaning the environment has the first and last say in how we contribute to its health and wellbeing. This ethos underpins what, where, how and when to do things and is not a prescription about nature, it is the Mauri Tūhono way. As a framework, it entrusts you to understand and follow the mauri, the dynamic flow of energy that propels you toward the best outcomes for te taiao. Mauri exists through connection, of people to place. In essence, this is Mauri Tūhono.

Mauri oho, Mauri rere, Mauri tau, Mauri Tūhono e!

Mō te Tūranga | About the Role:

The Pou Arataki Mauri Tūhono will work with the co-chairs to lead out He Hononga, the establishment phase. This requires working collaboratively to design a successful programme of action. It requires right leadership and sustainable financial management, to activate and progress the shifts for te taiao that are described in Kaipupuri Taonga ki te Ao Whānui. The ideal candidate will oversee and facilitate positive outcomes for mana whenua, community and kawanatanga. This will set the foundations for the following phase, Mahi Tūhono - implementation and transformation.

This is a fixed term role for 12 months to support the mahi to move from planning to implementation. You can be based in the central Wellington GWRC office or their new Masterton office.

Mōu | About You:

The Pou Arataki will feel and understand the kaupapa of Mauri Tūhono. You’ll have a passion for te taiao, will be an advocate for the special places and people of our rohe and along with understanding the mauri of the kaupapa, you’ll have the technical skills to complement. You’ll be able to balance high level strategic thinking while employing practical, on the ground approaches. With experience in project leadership and facilitation, you’ll move through challenges and with skills in planning and implementation, you’ll move this project to the next stages.

You’ll operate with tika and pono which in turn means you have strong relationship skills. A deep understanding of tikanga and mātauranga Māori as it relates to te taiao and an understanding of Te Tiriti o Waitangi will mean you are comfortable in different spaces connecting with diverse groups bringing them together on the Mauri Tūhono.

Ngā Painga | What we offer:

We’ll encourage you to grow and prosper with a range of learning and development opportunities, internal secondments and career progression. We believe we have a friendly and inclusive culture supporting you to have a sense of belonging, where you can reflect your personal and cultural identity in the way that you work and get involved in social clubs and staff networks. You can work to suit your life and whānau with the flexible working policy.

Your wellbeing is our priority – we’ll provide medical and trauma insurance, support through our employee assistance programme or Manawa Ora providers, generous annual and sick leave, along with Tangihanga leave and support.

Help us use our collective aspirations, knowledge and resources for a shared legacy so we can intertwine our restoration efforts together to weave a korowai. So that the mauri of te taiao will be sustained for all. He Mauri Tūhono!

With a whole-of-industry view of the electricity sector, we are at the forefront of the country's pending electricity transformation. Our team is working hard to enable accelerated electrification, and a sustainable net carbon zero future.

About The Team

Our Grid Delivery division is accountable for the delivery of all work across New Zealand's transmission network. This includes project and maintenance work, delivered in conjunction with our service provider organisations. Transpower delivers approximately $300M capex and $100M in opex per annum. Our Grid Works Delivery team ensures Transpower's asset management plan is delivered, built, and commissioned in a manner which meets the organisations strategic objectives.

About The Opportunity

Ideally based in Wellington, although Auckland, Palmerston North, or Christchurch will be considered, you'll be one of fifteen Investigation Project Managers operating in a playmaker role which will require you to reach into multiple parts of the business (and beyond where the projects are for external customers), including our Tactical Engineering, Asset Planning, System Planning, Economics, Property, Environment, Customer and Commercial teams.

Part time or job share options may be available for the right candidates.

While you'll be part of delivering projects, you'll also work with project owners in fashioning the scope and bringing players round the table from within and outside the business to work up concepts and solution studies that deliver great projects.

You'll lead and coordinate the work of a project team to manage and deliver investigation projects, with the development of concise, high-quality business cases and:



Ensure a seamless transition between the investigation and delivery phases of projects

Develop and manage effective relationships with customers and stakeholders to ensure expectations are met, there are no surprises and project outcomes are successfully delivered

Anticipate, identify and manage/raise issues and risks and ensure accurate and timely milestone and metrics



Projects can range from $250k to $100m plus. The team assesses a range of project types, including substation switchgear and secondary systems replacements and upgrades, lines reconductoring and strategic upgrades, building new substations, HVDC and reactive support projects, and strategic initiatives to support policy / specification updates.

You'll be involved in enabling major internal strategies such as Net Zero Grid Pathways and delivering investigations for Transpower's large capital projects, while also supporting external customers with their electrification projects. Example projects would include establishing new grid exit points (GXPs) for distribution networks, upgrading existing GXPs for industrial customers pursuing decarbonisation in their processes, and creating grid injection points (GIPs) for new battery energy storage systems (BESS), solar and wind farms.

You'll engage at all levels across Transpower, with our customers, stakeholders, consultants, and service providers. It's mentally stimulating and challenging work!

About You

Customer-centric, you'll use your outstanding relationship management skills to work collaboratively to ensure a shared vision with expectations and commercially successful project outcomes being achieved.

You'll have previously worked broadly and at pace, including with geographically based teams, to investigate find solutions, and solve problems.

To be considered, your CV and cover letter will be clearly articulate



A minimum of five years' experience in running successful projects (ideally in energy sector/critical infrastructure) using sound project management techniques and methodologies. This may be underpinned by a formal qualification or the desire to gain project management certification

Understanding of engineering or significant infrastructure projects and their life cycles

Experience in the development of complex commercial business cases and approval processes

Proven ability to question astutely while managing expectations and relationships

Well-developed and concise oral and written communication skills

Experience of delivering resilience-driven work programmes e.g., Seismic/fire building upgrades, flood/tsunami mitigations, slope stability remediation
