Our mission is to Ethically Democratize the AI Revolution. Since our founding in 2019, we have been busy assembling the largest consented user-behavioral dataset in the world outside the walled gardens of BigTech. We use that dataset to help companies, big and small, supercharge the work of their Machine Learning and Marketing teams in privacy protective ways.

At Yobi we believe that every employee should be empowered to own 0-1 contributions and have the opportunity to achieve real impact - and scale that impact - on the business. If that sounds like an exciting opportunity to you, we want to hear from you.

Yobi Highlights:


Partnerships with Microsoft and Databricks
Full remote or hybrid from several hubs (Boston, SF Bay Area, Seattle, NYC)
Team of ML Experts who worked on cutting edge recommender systems and internal tools @ Amazon, Uber, Twitter, Meta, etc.
Experts on the Product and Go-To-Market fronts who have taken ideas from concept to 9 figure revenue streams


Benefits:


Competitive Base Salary
Meaningful equity & financial upside - a real % of the company
Health, Dental, Vision
Flexible PTO
401k


About The Role

At Yobi, Applications teams bring the value in our User-Behavioral foundation models to market, creating scalable, highly profitable products with ML at their heart. These Applications products are key to Yobi success, as they ground the value of our R&D, power continuous experimentation and improvement, and provide significant data for improving our core embeddings.

As an MLE on this team, you will primarily be focused on the models, metrics, pipelines, systems, and services that power and deliver excellence via Yobi Applications products.

This role involves a large degree of 0-to-1 development, and will rely on collaboration with Product, core signals MLEs, and leaning on your own expertise and insight in building holistic ML-powered products. While we currently have a product in the market here, we invite big bets to expand impact and reach.

Significant ""wearing your Product hat"" is expected, along with driving results in the many domains required to deliver whole ML-powered products - we are a quickly growing startup after all!

What it takes to succeed in this role:


AdTech experience and product intuition for the space
Understanding enough about machine learning to be dangerous but not necessarily published in field
Worked on and can speak to some kinds of impactful consumer-facing ML problem, e.g. recommender systems, personalization, etc.
Skill and attitude wise, can quickly contribute to things such as orchestration/Airflow, Bazel (build systems, really), CI/CD, Spark (we have both Python and Scala), and other SQL-y data computation backends as needed. Not everybody is going to be a rockstar on all of these, and we are making novel tech investments across the company, but successful engineers will see opportunity and a path to (first) PR, instead of ""not my job"".
Good product sense, has opinions on what we should and shouldn’t be doing both in chasing product-market fit and on the implementation side.


We prioritize attitude, culture, and general (technical) fit over matching perfectly into one of our job descriptions. If our mission and work resonates with you, we encourage you to apply. Tell us how you can help drive our products forward, even if you don’t feel like you are a perfect fit for some of the listings.

About Phaidra

Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.

The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.

Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:


We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.
We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning.
We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.


Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.

Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office. We hire employees internationally with the help of our partner, OysterHR. Our team is currently located throughout the USA, Canada, UK, Norway, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Japan, Singapore, and India.

Who You Are

Research Scientists at Phaidra lead our efforts in developing novel algorithmic architecture towards the end goal of bringing intelligent control systems to industrial sector.

Having pioneered research in the world's leading academic and industrial labs as PhDs, post-docs or professors, Research Scientists join Phaidra to work collaboratively within and across research fields.

Machine Learning Engineer - AI Startup,Jaxon AI,United States,2024-08-22,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/machine-learning-engineer-ai-startup-at-jaxon-ai-4007813544?position=2&pageNum=20&refId=c79fG4FAXU7quIA0T95TIw%3D%3D&trackingId=rAVd6wiH1GucU1FS07sYww%3D%3D&trk=public_jobs_jserp-result_search-card,"Position Name: Machine Learning Engineer

Location: Lincoln, MA or Remote

Employment Type: Full-time

Citizenship: US Citizens only

Notes: Direct Hire. No third-party assistance is approved for this role.

About The Job: At Jaxon, we are on a mission to make AI trustworthy. The adoption of large language models (LLMs) in corporate settings is hindered by the “hallucination problem,” where AI models produce inaccurate or entirely fabricated responses. For regulated industries and high-risk applications, this issue is preventing LLM use altogether. This role is crucial in overcoming these challenges.

As a Machine Learning Engineer at Jaxon, you will be responsible for developing and implementing machine learning models and algorithms to create more reliable AI systems. You will play a key role in delivering complex AI-driven solutions for customers, with a particular focus on defense applications as Jaxon is dual-use.

We have a patent pending product, Domain-Specific AI Language (DSAIL), that forms the basis of most of our deployments. This role will be focused on increasing security and reliability for our customers through implementing DSAIL and building on its capabilities. A particular emphasis is placed on addressing the fundamental limitations of LLMs – they don’t understand context and logical reasoning. Once an LLM deviates from the right path, errors are more likely to occur. Training an AI away from this type of yes/no logic and into more human-like reasoning is at the core of this position.

The Basics Of This Role Requires The Ability To


Collaborate Across Teams: Work with cross-functional teams to integrate ML models into our existing systems and workflows, enhancing product capabilities.
Optimize Data Processing and Model Performance: Conduct comprehensive data management including preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to improve accuracy and efficiency.
Technical Proficiency: Demonstrate solid machine learning engineering experience, particularly with NLP applications and unstructured data in a cloud environment. Fluency in Python is essential.
Understand Machine Learning Models: Needs to be intimately familiar with the process, but deploying ML models will not be a regular part of the job.


Soft Skills


Able to context switch as needed
Able to compartmentalize different projects with different goals
Able to communicate clearly and precisely - not just abstractions and ""lines-and-boxes""


Specific Technologies


Docker, Docker Compose
Python
Python Data Science Stack - NumPy, Pandas, Scikit Learn, Various deep learning packages
Familiarity with calling web API's and making web API's
Familiarity with modular architectures - IPC, publish-subscribe, etc…


Nice-To-Haves


Familiarity with predicate logic
Familiarity with Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) notation for language grammars
Lisp languages


About Jaxon: Jaxon is a leading provider of machine learning and artificial intelligence solutions. We are committed to helping our customers solve complex problems with AI. Our products and services are used by businesses of all sizes, from startups to Fortune 500 companies.

What Makes Jaxon Different?


Human First: Our leaders get it — life happens. Whether it’s flexible working hours or understanding the need for a mental health day, we prioritize your well-being. Our CEO recognizes that happy people do the best work and he backs that up with an empathetically led culture – and I’m not just saying that because he’s going to read this post.
Laid-Back Culture: We know that the best work comes from a place of comfort and authenticity. At Jaxon, you’re encouraged to be yourself, dress casually, and embrace your quirky side. It’s just one of the benefits of being an early-stage, high-growth startup.
Tech Lover's Dream: From hackathons to tech talks with industry leaders, we fuel our passion for innovation with constant learning and development opportunities.
Grunt Work to Grand Projects: Every task you tackle, big or small, matters. You think I’m writing job descriptions for fun? Sometimes things need to get done and it’s an all hands on deck situation to get them to the finish line. We're looking for team players who understand that achieving groundbreaking AI innovations sometimes involves rolling up your sleeves to tackle the essential, yet less glamorous tasks.
Excited about the prospect of free snacks, massages, and a hot tub at the office? You might have to keep looking, as we're a fully remote team. However, if you ever feel the need to switch up your work environment, you’re always welcome at our office space in Lincoln, Massachusetts—includes a dartboard for slow afternoons.


Added Perks


Unlimited PTO: (seriously!)
Comprehensive benefits: Health, dental, and vision insurance
Competitive Salary: We provide competitive compensation packages commensurate with experience
Stock Options: All compensation plans include stock options - join now and benefit from future acquisitions
Holidays Off: ALL federal holidays are paid time off.


About You: You're the type of person who's naturally driven—not necessarily because you built a rocket in your backyard as a kid, but because you have a genuine curiosity about the world of technology. In your spare time, you might find yourself deep-diving into technology subreddits, following the latest industry trends, or exploring which companies are innovating and how. Your passion isn't just about staying informed; it's about thinking how you can take these emerging concepts and scale them up, make them faster, or more impactful. At Jaxon, we're looking for someone who sees a baseline and instinctively wants to build beyond it. If you’re ready to take what exists and make it extraordinary, you’ll fit right in.

Job Description

The engineering team at Jaxon warned me that all engineers hate when job descriptions specify bullet lists of X years of experience in technology Y such that time_exists(Y) < X. With that being said, there are no hard tech requirements, but experience with the python ML ecosystem and with LLMs is expected. Additionally:


You should have a comfort level building and training models, not just calling cloud APIs, but you’re resourceful enough to recognize when you can use cloud APIs whenever you can get away with it.
You aren’t afraid of digesting academic papers, but you understand that it’s code that matters.
You’re going to need proven expertise in building ML applications.
Proficient Python including demonstrable experience with libraries relevant to data manipulation.
Ideally some experience with machine learning, in particular NLP applications.
You are primarily in a development role, but are comfortable being customer-facing when needed.
Active security clearance is a bonus.


We are looking for somebody who thrives in an environment where day-to-day priorities and tasks may rapidly change. The role is not a fit if you value ""business as usual"".

We value team members who are bold enough to pitch creative ideas, even if they're still rough around the edges or might not make the final cut.

Education And Length Of Experience

Preferably applicants will have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science or similar, however at Jaxon, we value skills and dedication over degrees. We strongly encourage people without degrees to apply if you have at least 5 years of experience.

Jaxon is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is an affirmative action employer. We are committed to equal employment opportunities regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status, disability, or Veteran status

Upstart is a leading AI lending marketplace partnering with banks and credit unions to expand access to affordable credit. By leveraging Upstart's AI marketplace, Upstart-powered banks and credit unions can have higher approval rates and lower loss rates across races, ages, and genders, while simultaneously delivering the exceptional digital-first lending experience their customers demand. More than two-thirds of Upstart loans are approved instantly and are fully automated.

Upstart is a digital-first company, which means that most Upstarters live and work anywhere in the United States. However, we also have offices in San Mateo, California; Columbus, Ohio; and Austin, Texas.

Most Upstarters join us because they connect with our mission of enabling access to effortless credit based on true risk. If you are energized by the impact you can make at Upstart, we’d love to hear from you!

The Team and Role

Upstart’s Machine Learning team has a direct impact on our company's success. The team consists of full-stack applied science generalists as well as specialists in research, data science, statistical modeling and machine learning. The fundamental goal of the Machine Learning team is to explore new models and new data sets that can improve the accuracy of our models. With this goal comes near-limitless challenges to tackle, and that is one of the reasons why Upstart is such a unique opportunity.

As Manager of Machine Learning, you will lead a team of 2 research scientists and a data scientist on our Small Dollar Lending product, an unsecured personal lending product for small, short-term loans. The team focuses on modeling credit risk and operational costs, and making corresponding underwriting and pricing decisions.

Time Zone Requirements - This team operates on either the East or West Coast time zones.
Travel Requirements - This team has regular on-site collaboration sessions. ML Managers can anticipate working in either HQ 3 days/week 6 times/year. Since this is a leadership position, a few additional travel dates may be possible for onsite collaborations with other teams. If you need to travel to make these meetups, Upstart will cover all travel related expenses.


How you’ll make an impact:


Lead your team to apply state-of-the-art machine learning methods (e.g. recurrent neural networks, gradient boosting methods for survival time prediction, model ensembling and stacking) to a critical prediction problem (credit risk) where machine learning is not widely applied and the optimal solutions are not known.
Search for new variables, either internal to Upstart, or from external vendors, that can improve our underwriting models’ performance.
Work with the Small Dollar Lending team to identify opportunities for new ML models to be used in credit decisioning.
Along with your team, assume responsibility for the performance of Upstart’s loan originations for the Small Dollar Lending product.


Minimum qualifications:


Bachelor’s degree in quantitative area of study
1+ years as a data science or machine learning people manager or tech lead
Understanding of machine learning models and statistical methods
Coding proficiency, preferably in Python
Excellent quantitative critical thinking skills


Preferred qualifications:


Advanced degree in quantitative area of study such as statistics, operations research, finance, mathematics, or related field
Prior experience managing teams that build machine learning models, prepare them for production, and make large, direct contributions to a business’ profitability
Consumer lending knowledge and/or experience within an ML-centric technology company is a plus


What you'll love:


Competitive Compensation (base + bonus & equity)
Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage with Health Savings Account contributions from Upstart
401(k) with 100% company match up to $4,500 and immediate vesting and after-tax savings

Annual wellness, technology & ergonomic reimbursement programs
Social activities including team events and onsites, all-company updates, employee resource groups (ERGs), and other interest groups such as book clubs, fitness, investing, and volunteering
Catered lunches + snacks & drinks when working in offices


At Upstart, your base pay is one part of your total compensation package. The anticipated base salary for this position is expected to be within the below range. Your actual base pay will depend on your geographic location–with our “digital first” philosophy, Upstart uses compensation regions that vary depending on location. Individual pay is also determined by job-related skills, experience, and relevant education or training. Your recruiter can share more about the specific salary range for your preferred location during the hiring process.

In addition, Upstart provides employees with target bonuses, equity compensation, and generous benefits packages (including medical, dental, vision, and 401k).

United States | Remote - Anticipated Base Salary Range

$174,900—$242,000 USD
