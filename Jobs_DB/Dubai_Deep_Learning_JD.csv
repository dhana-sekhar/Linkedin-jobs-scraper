Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, 2 Hour Learning. Have you got what it takes?

Are you a skilled full-stack developer with a passion for AI and a drive to transform K-12 education? At 2 Hour Learning, we're leading a revolution in digital learning backed by data and innovation.

At 2 Hour Learning, we don't just aim to improve education—we're redefining it. Our cutting-edge learning ecosystem, powered by advanced AI, learning science, and psychometrics, is twice as effective as traditional schooling. Students at every level, from kindergarten to high school, are achieving remarkable academic milestones, far surpassing standard expectations.

Your Role in the Revolution:

In this role, you’ll be at the forefront of our AI-powered educational transformation. With full autonomy and creative freedom, you’ll envision, develop, and deploy sophisticated full-stack applications and interactive AI tools that not only engage students but also enhance learning efficiency in unprecedented ways.

This is not a position for those who prefer to specialize in a single aspect of development. We're looking for innovative thinkers who can seamlessly integrate AI across both front-end and back-end systems, taking ownership of the entire product. Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology.

Who We're Looking For:

We need bold innovators who thrive on leveraging the latest in generative AI to create real-world educational impact. If you’re excited about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI-driven education and are ready to bring your expertise in full-stack development and AI, this is your chance to make a difference.

What You Will Be Doing


Develop AI-Powered Web Applications: Architect and code sophisticated web applications that integrate both front-end and back-end components, with a focus on enhancing user experience through AI.
Experiment and Innovate with AI: Work with cutting-edge AI technologies, specifically large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or Claude, to create autonomous tools and interactive features that redefine how students learn.

Continuous Improvement: Stay ahead of the curve by continually learning and applying the latest advancements in AI and web development to our platform.


What You Won’t Be Doing


Narrow AI Development: You won’t be working on isolated AI features that don’t integrate with the overall product strategy. Your work will have a direct impact on thousands of students.
Surface-Level Coding: This is not a role for those who focus only on either front-end or back-end development. You will be expected to integrate both, creating comprehensive and scalable solutions.
Routine Maintenance: This role is not about maintaining legacy systems or making minor updates. You will be driving innovation and building new, cutting-edge applications.
Waiting for Detailed Specifications: You won't be handed fully fleshed-out requirements. Instead, you will take high-level ideas and translate them into fully developed products, leveraging your expertise in AI and full-stack development.
Working in Isolation: You won't be coding in a vacuum. Collaboration with other developers, product managers, and educational experts is key to ensuring that the solutions you build are impactful and user-centered.


Artificial Intelligence Engineer Key Responsibilities

Develop and deliver engaging, human-centered AI applications that demonstrably accelerate learning outcomes and efficiency for thousands of K-12 students.

Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, 2 Hour Learning. Have you got what it takes?

Are you ready to unleash the potential of AI to redefine student achievement?

At 2 Hour Learning, we're not content to merely adopt AI—we've encoded it into our DNA. We've re-engineered the learning experience from the ground up, harnessing AI and learning science breakthroughs to shatter the confines of the traditional school day. The result? Students who don't just meet the bar—they vault over it.

The proof of our approach is undeniable: students using our platform consistently achieve 4s and 5s on five or more AP exams, demonstrate more than two years' growth on yearly MAP assessments, and shatter their own expectations of what they can achieve. If you're energized by the opportunity to deliver transformative results at an unprecedented scale, 2 Hour Learning is where you belong.

You'll serve as the chief architect behind our revolutionary learning ecosystem for your dedicated school model, which spans multiple campuses.

Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, 2 Hour Learning. Have you got what it takes?

Are you ready to unleash the potential of AI to redefine student achievement?

At 2 Hour Learning, we're not content to merely adopt AI—we've encoded it into our DNA. We've re-engineered the learning experience from the ground up, harnessing AI and learning science breakthroughs to shatter the confines of the traditional school day. The result? Students who don't just meet the bar—they vault over it.

The proof of our approach is undeniable: students using our platform consistently achieve 4s and 5s on five or more AP exams, demonstrate more than two years' growth on yearly MAP assessments, and shatter their own expectations of what they can achieve. If you're energized by the opportunity to deliver transformative results at an unprecedented scale, 2 Hour Learning is where you belong.

You'll serve as the chief architect behind our revolutionary learning ecosystem for your dedicated school model, which spans multiple campuses. Fueled by an unwavering commitment to student success, you'll tap into the boundless potential of AI to craft hyper-personalized learning journeys that adapt to each student's unique needs, interests, and aspirations.

Your role will be a perfect blend of data-driven strategy and hands-on engagement. You'll dive deep into learning analytics, uncovering key insights to drive exponential growth. But you won't just crunch numbers from afar—you'll be on the front lines, working directly with students to understand their experiences, challenges, and triumphs. This firsthand knowledge will be invaluable as you pinpoint the specific motivational levers and pedagogical strategies to shatter achievement ceilings across all campuses.

You'll empower a dynamic team of learning engineers, data scientists, and instructional innovators to bring your vision to life. But more importantly, you'll be a champion for our students, ensuring that every decision, every innovation, and every strategy is laser-focused on improving their learning outcomes.

This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to apply AI to education and fundamentally redefine what's possible. Armed with the predictive power of advanced learning analytics, the ability to A/B test pedagogical hypotheses at scale, and an institutional mandate to push boundaries, you'll blaze new trails daily.

Building new AI models from scratch; instead, your focus will be on leveraging and fine-tuning existing models to maximize efficiency.
Being confined to outdated technologies; we encourage an environment that thrives on dynamic tech stacks, fostering continuous innovation.
