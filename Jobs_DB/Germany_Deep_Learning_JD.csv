Together with your colleagues you will take care of the machine learning software stack and thereby enable our teams to build medical grade quality and scalable machine learning models. At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

About the Team

The Selection Analytics Team at Wolt owns the data and infrastructure that helps all 27 of our markets build a portfolio of high-quality restaurant and retail merchants. Our overarching mission is to provide the best selection to customers by enabling sales teams across all markets to acquire the best merchants.

To do this, we work directly with country sales teams to help them identify and prioritize the highest potential merchant candidates. We also work with Wolt leadership by providing metrics to track selection quality, upon which they develop strategic initiatives and goals. This is a lean and mighty team that owns and operates the engine for merchant acquisition globally.

About The Role

As a senior member of the Selection Analytics team, your role involves leveling up our approach to identifying and prioritizing better merchants. You’ll achieve this by a) developing metrics to unlock deeper insights into merchant selection quality for all markets b) developing and running experiments to understand the impact of selection on specific markets c) develop self-serve tooling to track these insights

This is also a rare, high-exposure experience where you will then use your findings to work directly with country leadership to help them uncover growth opportunities. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just crunching numbers and creating dashboards.

The team is looking for a versatile analytics expert who knows how to move fast, work cross-functionally, and deliver business results. If you are excited to build from 0 to 1, interested in global exposure, and have experience using deep analytics to solve hard problems - we're looking for someone like you.

Our humble expectations


3-5 years of experience in data science, consulting, or related quantitative role
Strong exploratory data analysis skills, willingness to look under the hood.
Deep understanding of the data science workflow, including experimental design and key statistical methods, with strong communication skills for complex topics.
Proficiency in statistical programming languages (R, Python, etc.) and SQL.
Proficiency in one or more analytics & visualization tools (e.g. Looker)
Determination to initiate and lead/own strategic projects to completion in a scrappy environment with a cross-functional team
Innate curiosity to understand how things work and a first-principles approach to problem solving


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, 2 Hour Learning. Have you got what it takes?

Are you a skilled full-stack developer with a passion for AI and a drive to transform K-12 education? At 2 Hour Learning, we're leading a revolution in digital learning backed by data and innovation.

At 2 Hour Learning, we don't just aim to improve education—we're redefining it. Our cutting-edge learning ecosystem, powered by advanced AI, learning science, and psychometrics, is twice as effective as traditional schooling. Students at every level, from kindergarten to high school, are achieving remarkable academic milestones, far surpassing standard expectations.

Your Role in the Revolution:

In this role, you’ll be at the forefront of our AI-powered educational transformation. With full autonomy and creative freedom, you’ll envision, develop, and deploy sophisticated full-stack applications and interactive AI tools that not only engage students but also enhance learning efficiency in unprecedented ways.

This is not a position for those who prefer to specialize in a single aspect of development. We're looking for innovative thinkers who can seamlessly integrate AI across both front-end and back-end systems, taking ownership of the entire product. Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology.

Who We're Looking For:

We need bold innovators who thrive on leveraging the latest in generative AI to create real-world educational impact. If you’re excited about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI-driven education and are ready to bring your expertise in full-stack development and AI, this is your chance to make a difference.

What You Will Be Doing


Develop AI-Powered Web Applications: Architect and code sophisticated web applications that integrate both front-end and back-end components, with a focus on enhancing user experience through AI.
Experiment and Innovate with AI: Work with cutting-edge AI technologies, specifically large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or Claude, to create autonomous tools and interactive features that redefine how students learn.

Continuous Improvement: Stay ahead of the curve by continually learning and applying the latest advancements in AI and web development to our platform.


What You Won’t Be Doing


Narrow AI Development: You won’t be working on isolated AI features that don’t integrate with the overall product strategy. Your work will have a direct impact on thousands of students.
Surface-Level Coding: This is not a role for those who focus only on either front-end or back-end development. You will be expected to integrate both, creating comprehensive and scalable solutions.
Routine Maintenance: This role is not about maintaining legacy systems or making minor updates. You will be driving innovation and building new, cutting-edge applications.
Waiting for Detailed Specifications: You won't be handed fully fleshed-out requirements. Instead, you will take high-level ideas and translate them into fully developed products, leveraging your expertise in AI and full-stack development.
Working in Isolation: You won't be coding in a vacuum. Collaboration with other developers, product managers, and educational experts is key to ensuring that the solutions you build are impactful and user-centered.


Artificial Intelligence Engineer Key Responsibilities

Develop and deliver engaging, human-centered AI applications that demonstrably accelerate learning outcomes and efficiency for thousands of K-12 students.

Basic Requirements


At least 3 years of experience in full-stack development, with proficiency in front-end frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue.js, or Svelte, and back-end technologies like Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, Flask, or Spring Boot.

Proven ability to independently manage and execute technical projects from start to finish, including gathering requirements, development, deployment, and iteration.

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Your job will mainly focus on driving operational efficiency with the Workforce Management (WFM) team and optimizing resource allocation by creating accurate scheduling and intraday forecasts, simplifying forecasting processes, building and supporting KPI dashboards, conducting root cause analysis for SLA improvements, exploring cost optimization opportunities, managing the capacity plan framework, enhancing the WFM data pipeline, and uncovering data-driven insights to refine planning, scheduling, reporting, and intraday management.

You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.

Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
3+ years of experience in a data science or analytics position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Exceptional communications skills, with the ability to influence and advise senior stakeholders through telling exciting and valuable stories from any data exploration

Head of Machine Learning Platform and Developer Productivity (all genders),Zalando,Germany,2024-08-09,https://de.linkedin.com/jobs/view/head-of-machine-learning-platform-and-developer-productivity-all-genders-at-zalando-3997212985?position=6&pageNum=15&refId=we5PSiG9tcyOkdqvDNPRzA%3D%3D&trackingId=hi0xxB%2BP%2B3JbxM4Ocmj60A%3D%3D&trk=public_jobs_jserp-result_search-card,"ABOUT THE TEAM

The ML Platform & Developer Productivity department consists of five teams supporting almost

2000 Software Engineers and Applied Scientists all over Zalando across the whole Software

Development and ML Ops livecycle. By offering the best tools and processes well integrated into

our central “Sunrise” platform backed by backstage.io open source software, the team has a high

impact on how fast and safe delivery teams in Zalando can experiment, build, test, and ship to

production.

Our vision is that Engineers and Applied Scientists have all the tools they need at their fingertips.

They can easily access documentation, pre-built services, and templates to build new solutions

quickly. The technical setup is largely standardised, making it easy to upgrade without

distractions. Teams start with default templates and can customise if needed. Changes can be

rolled out to production in minutes, multiple times a day, and we separate deployments from

rollouts, allowing us to enable or disable features centrally. This fast pace of experimentation and

testing helps prevent incidents. If something goes wrong, we detect the issue automatically and

safely roll back changes so experts can investigate without stress.







THE ROLE

As the Head of Machine Learning Platform & Developer Productivity responsible for 5 teams, you

will be pivotal in defining, enabling and optimising our ML Development Lifecycle and ensuring

teams across all of Zalando can deliver high-quality models efficiently and effectively. You will

lead initiatives to improve productivity across our ML platform, from data preparation and model

development to deployment and monitoring. This role requires a unique blend of technical

expertise, leadership, and a deep understanding of ML operations (MLOps) best practices. As a

senior level technology expert, you will not only play a pivotal role in the design of our tools and

systems that power our core ecommerce operations and experiences used by millions of

customers every day.

As the scope of this role includes a crucial part of the Software Development Lifecycle from how

we write and test code to continuous integration and delivery, this role offers unique

opportunities to shape a holistic vision of modern software development to consistently execute

against. In collaboration with the director, your peers, product management, key stakeholders,

and your engineering teams you will shape the future of our internal, software engineer and

applied science facing digital products, serving 250+ teams delivering ~20k builds and 10k

deployments per week to Kubernetes on AWS.







WE’D LOVE TO MEET YOU IF YOU

● Have a minimum of 8 years of experience in Software Engineering or Applied Machine

Learning, with at least 3 years in a leadership role managing multiple technical and

interdisciplinary teams.

● Have a track record of delivering company wide systems and solutions at scale for

applied machine learning. You have a strong background in machine learning, data

engineering, and software development, with hands-on experience in building and scaling

ML systems.

● Are proficient in MLOps practices, tools and techniques and comfortable working in and

enabling a culture of operational and production excellence.

● Possess strong executive stakeholder management and product management thinking

(optional and not required, but highly desirable). You are a great leader, and leader of

leaders, and able to support and guide many teams and business units towards the same

goal and unified approaches.

● Have strong know-how in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Science, or

Data Science. A PhD is a plus, but not a necessity.

● Have a record of attracting, developing, and retaining exceptional talent.
