Our mission is to Ethically Democratize the AI Revolution. Since our founding in 2019, we have been busy assembling the largest consented user-behavioral dataset in the world outside the walled gardens of BigTech. We use that dataset to help companies, big and small, supercharge the work of their Machine Learning and Marketing teams in privacy protective ways.

At Yobi we believe that every employee should be empowered to own 0-1 contributions and have the opportunity to achieve real impact - and scale that impact - on the business. If that sounds like an exciting opportunity to you, we want to hear from you.

Yobi Highlights:


Partnerships with Microsoft and Databricks
Full remote or hybrid from several hubs (Boston, SF Bay Area, Seattle, NYC)
Team of ML Experts who worked on cutting edge recommender systems and internal tools @ Amazon, Uber, Twitter, Meta, etc.

Meaningful equity & financial upside - a real % of the company

About The Role

At Yobi, Applications teams bring the value in our User-Behavioral foundation models to market, creating scalable, highly profitable products with ML at their heart. These Applications products are key to Yobi success, as they ground the value of our R&D, power continuous experimentation and improvement, and provide significant data for improving our core embeddings.

As an MLE on this team, you will primarily be focused on the models, metrics, pipelines, systems, and services that power and deliver excellence via Yobi Applications products.

This role involves a large degree of 0-to-1 development, and will rely on collaboration with Product, core signals MLEs, and leaning on your own expertise and insight in building holistic ML-powered products. While we currently have a product in the market here, we invite big bets to expand impact and reach.

Significant ""wearing your Product hat"" is expected, along with driving results in the many domains required to deliver whole ML-powered products - we are a quickly growing startup after all!

What it takes to succeed in this role:


AdTech experience and product intuition for the space
Understanding enough about machine learning to be dangerous but not necessarily published in field
Worked on and can speak to some kinds of impactful consumer-facing ML problem, e.g. recommender systems, personalization, etc.
Skill and attitude wise, can quickly contribute to things such as orchestration/Airflow, Bazel (build systems, really), CI/CD, Spark (we have both Python and Scala), and other SQL-y data computation backends as needed. Not everybody is going to be a rockstar on all of these, and we are making novel tech investments across the company, but successful engineers will see opportunity and a path to (first) PR, instead of ""not my job"".
Good product sense, has opinions on what we should and shouldn’t be doing both in chasing product-market fit and on the implementation side.


We prioritize attitude, culture, and general (technical) fit over matching perfectly into one of our job descriptions. If our mission and work resonates with you, we encourage you to apply. Tell us how you can help drive our products forward, even if you don’t feel like you are a perfect fit for some of the listings.
