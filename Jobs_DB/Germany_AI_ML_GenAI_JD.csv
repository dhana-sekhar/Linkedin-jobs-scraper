We would also like you to have strong experience in leading a technical Data Science team to make sure we keep on improving our DS best practices at Wolt while taking care of our people;
You have previous experience from making personal development plans, hosting regular 1on1s, and taking part in recruitment;

Interest towards LLMs and GenAI and their applications to solving problems in production.
You’ll also need to be the representative of your function towards the rest of the organization, so strong communication and presentation skills are needed. We value experience in working with senior stakeholders to set the team vision and direction.
Lastly, as this is a team effort you have to be a strong cultural leader that cares for the well-being and constant improvement of your team members and represents Wolt values as your daily work.

DEINE ROLLE - DAS WARTET AUF DICH

Du löst mit Begeisterung Probleme, arbeitest gerne mit Kunden und hast eine Leidenschaft für die Entwicklung innovativer Technologielösungen? Außerdem möchtest du Teil eines engagierten Teams, das sich darauf konzentriert, die Welt mit KI und kognitiven Technologien zu revolutionieren, werden? Dann bist du bei adesso genau richtig!

In deiner Rolle als Managing Consultant bist du für die Vermarktung, Beratung und Implementierung von KI- und kognitiven Lösungen verantwortlich, die auf der Microsoft-Cloud-Plattform basieren. Dabei berätst du den C-Level unserer Kunden in den frühen Phasen der Microsoft AI-Adoption, arbeitest AI-Governance Konzepte und Business Cases aus und führst die Kunden von der Strategie in das konkrete Implementierungsprojekt. Außerdem entwickelst du dazu neue innovative Lösungsansätze aus den Bereichen künstliches Lesen, Sehen, Verstehen und Generieren. Dazu zählen insbesondere auch der Umgang mit Large Language Models, Natural Language Processing und Conversational AI, wie Azure OpenAI.

Im Detail übernimmst du dabei folgende Aufgaben:


Beratung und Führung unserer Kunden auf Management Ebene in den Frühphasen der KI-Nutzung
Projektleitung und Architekturverantwortung bei der Entwicklung sowie Implementierung von KI- und kognitiven Lösungen auf der Microsoft-AI-Plattform
Zusammenarbeit mit dem Account Executive und Engineering-Team, um sicherzustellen, dass die Plattform auf dem neuesten Stand der Technik ist und den Bedürfnissen der Kunden entspricht
Entwicklung und Umsetzung von Strategien zur Vermarktung der AI-Dienstleistungen und zur Gewinnung neuer Kunden
Schulung von Entwicklerinnen und Entwicklern und anderen interessierten Parteien in der Verwendung der Plattform
Zusammenarbeit mit Kunden, um deren Bedürfnisse zu verstehen und (entsprechende) Lösungen zu entwickeln


DEINE SKILLS - DAS BRINGST DU MIT


Abgeschlossenes Studium in Informatik, Mathematik, Ingenieurwissenschaften oder einem verwandten Bereich
Mehrjährige Erfahrung in der Entwicklung und Implementierung von KI-, Machine-Learning- und kognitiven Lösungen auf der Microsoft-Plattform wie z.B. Azure ML Studio sowie wünschenswert sind erste Kenntnisse in Azure OpenAI Service, OpenAI API, Power Platform AI Builder, CoPilot Studio
Erfahrung in der Beratung von Kunden im Vorfeld von Entwicklungsprojekten mit GenAI-, Machine-Learning- und NLP-Lösungen auf der Microsoft-Plattform, insbesondere Azure ML Studio, CoPilot-Studio sowie Erfahrungen im Bereich Prompt Engineering & Prompt Design
Kenntnisse in der Programmierung und im Umgang mit C#, Python und spezifischen Auswertungsumgebungen wie z.B. Jupyter Notebooks
Erfahrung in der eigenen Umsetzung und dem Training von NLP-Modellen, Durchführung von Model Refinements und Einsatz von Machine Learning Verfahren wie z.B. Diffusions-basierte Methoden
Gute Kommunikationsstärke, Organisationsfähigkeiten und die Fähigkeit, in einem dynamischen und sich schnell verändernden Umfeld zu arbeiten


Unser Versprechen: Du wirst dich bei uns wohlfühlen! Kollegial, familiär und auf Augenhöhe – wir leben Austausch, Teamgeist und einen respektvollen Umgang miteinander. Diversität und verschiedene Blickwinkel werden bei uns genauso geschätzt wie du als Mensch. Das und viel mehr steht für unser ganz besonderes Wir-Gefühl. Für das es sogar ein Wort gibt: adessi.

Unsere Kultur und das Zusammenarbeiten sind geprägt von gegenseitiger Wertschätzung, Anerkennung und Unterstützung. Das verbindet uns hierarchieübergreifend – auch im Home-Office. So belegen wir zum wiederholten Mal den 1. Platz beim Wettbewerb „Deutschlands Beste Arbeitgeber in der ITK“!. Unser umfangreiches Trainingsangebot und ein transparentes Laufbahnstufenmodell für alle sorgen dafür, dass deine Entwicklung bei uns nicht stillsteht. Denn gemeinsam zu wachsen und Chancengeber zu sein, das ist programmiert in unserer DNA.
