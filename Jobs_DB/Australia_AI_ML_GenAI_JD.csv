GAIIC provides opportunities to innovate in a fast-paced organization that contributes to game-changing projects and technologies that get deployed on devices and in the cloud.

The ideal candidate will also have a demonstrated ability to think strategically about business, product, and technical issues. Finally, and of critical importance, the candidate will be an excellent technical team manager, someone who knows how to hire, develop, and retain high quality technical talent.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a complete set of cloud services that enable all companies, from startups to enterprises, to run virtually everything in the cloud, including mobile applications, big data analytics, AI/ML platforms, and microservices/serverless infrastructures. Startups, which are now primarily born-in-the-cloud, represent a critically important and growing subset of customers to AWS. Startups have unique needs, priorities, and growth trajectories that distinguish them from traditional businesses and require different engagement strategies and sales motions from sellers to effectively acquire, grow, and retain them long-term on the AWS platform.

As AWS continues to rapidly grow, we seek an Startup Account Manager to help drive the growth of high-potential early, mid, and late stage startups. Your responsibilities will include driving revenue and user adoption, migrations, and ensuring new startups select AWS as their primary cloud provider. You will align closely with counterparts in business development, marketing, solution architecture and partner teams to lead execution of coordinated go-to-market strategies and sales plays. You will also work closely with business development teams who are driving strategic support, global co-programming, and portfolio engagement to help drive top-of-funnel customer acquisition and accelerate seller cycles in the field.

You will be at the heart of latest trends like GenAI, machine learning (ML), data/analytics and many other hypergrowth services. Your customers leverage state-of-the-art technologies on AWS to innovate and become the next disrupters, like today’s Canva, Atlassian, Leonardo.ai and many more. You are passionate about startups and scaleups, a self-starter with a strong entrepreneurial spirit who is prepared to work in a fast-paced, often ambiguous environment, execute against ambitious goals, and consistently embrace the Amazon Culture.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a complete set of cloud services that enable all companies, from startups to enterprises, to run virtually everything in the cloud, including mobile applications, big data analytics, AI/ML platforms, and microservices/serverless infrastructures. Startups, which are now primarily born-in-the-cloud, represent a critically important and growing subset of customers to AWS. Startups have unique needs, priorities, and growth trajectories that distinguish them from traditional businesses and require different engagement strategies and sales motions from sellers to effectively acquire, grow, and retain them long-term on the AWS platform.

As AWS continues to rapidly grow, we seek an Startup Account Manager to help drive the growth of high-potential early, mid, and late stage startups. Your responsibilities will include driving revenue and user adoption, migrations, and ensuring new startups select AWS as their primary cloud provider. You will align closely with counterparts in business development, marketing, solution architecture and partner teams to lead execution of coordinated go-to-market strategies and sales plays. You will also work closely with business development teams who are driving strategic support, global co-programming, and portfolio engagement to help drive top-of-funnel customer acquisition and accelerate seller cycles in the field.

You will be at the heart of latest trends like GenAI, machine learning (ML), data/analytics and many other hypergrowth services. Your customers leverage state-of-the-art technologies on AWS to innovate and become the next disrupters, like today’s Canva, Atlassian, Leonardo.ai and many more. You are passionate about startups and scaleups, a self-starter with a strong entrepreneurial spirit who is prepared to work in a fast-paced, often ambiguous environment, execute against ambitious goals, and consistently embrace the Amazon Culture.
