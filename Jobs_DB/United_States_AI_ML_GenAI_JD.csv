By living and working with intelligent technologies, businesses and the humans that drive them will operate at a level far beyond our previous potential. We call this the autonomous age. This will create a paradigm shift for humanity, positively impacting everything from drug discovery to disease management. From the crops we grow, the products we use, to the way we live our lives.

If you are passionate about the intersection of AI and innovation, come join us in our quest to build the future with autonomous innovation.

BOI is seeking an AI Product Manager to spearhead various AI-driven engines. This role involves direct engagement with clients, prospects, and our technology team to identify user needs and lead the build of the products that solve them. You would drive the end-to-end product management of tools that leverage foundational models to create custom-solutions for clients. Experience in the data science and commercial application side of AI is of higher preference than working with machine or deep learning directly. The role is an exciting opportunity for a client-facing PM to flex across data, product, and technology.

Our Team Ethos

Rip Up the Rule Book: We are hungry to challenge the status quo and innovate beyond traditional boundaries. We have strong opinions but still relish a challenge.

Collaborative Leadership: We build on each other’s strengths, and leadership dynamically shifts depending on the timing and topic.

Open and Transparent: We don’t work behind closed doors; instead, we open source our workings as we go.

Technology Forward: We harness cutting-edge AI technologies to drive innovation and create impactful solutions. We are committed to continuous learning and experimentation, ensuring our team is always equipped with the latest AI tools and knowledge to tackle complex challenges and disrupt and redefine industries.

Our work and our partnerships are centered around helping businesses innovate, build, and transform for the autonomous age. We align with clients who are ready to make significant and meaningful changes, not just simple improvements, embodying a spirit that seeks to revolutionize industries and practices with every project.

Ideal Candidate Profile

We're Looking For

Technical expertise: With your background in leading the build and launch of powerful products, you are a subject matter expert on industry-leading products that harness the capabilities of a gen-AI at scale. You have a solid understanding of the technology that goes into building products (whether AI-driven or not) and how data is leveraged to ensure that AI is effective and value-driven.

Preference for data skew: knowledge of tools like Tableau, PowerBI, Looker, Python, or SQL is helpful, in addition to experience with traditional PM tools like JIRA, Confluence or Trello.

Experience in consultancies or agencies is required: this role is an exciting opportunity to work across different sectors, clients, geographies, and business challenges and will require experience in being able to adapt to different client cases. Given our broad client base, candidates without consultancy or agency experience will not be considered for this role.

Previous experience as a product manager: knowledge of code is extremely helpful and we welcome candidates with diverse PM backgrounds that could include experience in strategy, design, client services, or engineering, but this role won’t be the right fit for engineers or other disciplines looking to transition to their first PM role.

An excellent communicator: You can easily translate complex AI capabilities into user-friendly and valuable solutions for our clients businesses.

Strategic Gen-AI Innovator with a Proven Track Record: You have worked on innovations in GenAI and can showcase AI-project implementations through projects, publication, or roles in AI initiatives.

Collaborative Explorer with a Passion for Learning: You are a curious learner with a relentless drive to challenge the status quo and reinvent businesses for an autonomous age. Your collaborative spirit enables you to work effectively in diverse teams, fostering an environment of collective innovation and knowledge sharing.

Entrepreneurial Spirit: You approach your work with an entrepreneurial mindset. You thrive on building trusted relationships and you have a strong empathy for our clients, building an understanding of the biggest opportunities to address their pain points.

What You'll Do

As Part Of Our Team, You Will

Guide the end-to end product vision and strategy: Oversee & own product roadmap and goals and lead the team to build AI-powered products & services. Be an expert on the domain, the market and trends.

Define functional requirements: Develop detailed product specifications and work directly with engineering team to structure sprint-driven roadmaps using agile methodologies

Build partnerships: Work closely with our clients and their engineering & tech teams as well as external stakeholders. Drive clarity and commitment & set high standards for delivering complex AI workloads.

Act as an AI Pioneer: Understand and adapt to various client tech stacks across cloud platforms, front end and back end programming languages, and various integrations (e.g. Snowflake, Databricks, CMS, etc.). Direct experience is preferred, but isn't required, while an ability to establish the technical feasibility of an existing tech stack, identify implications, and suggest alternative solutions if needed will be critical

Guide and Develop Team Skills: Apply technical AI/ ML/MLOps knowledge to enhance the current systems and architecture. Team up with our leaders to enhance skills and confidence of team members, sharing knowledge, giving feedback, and creating learning opportunities.

Grow Client Accounts: Build strategic, profitable long-term relationships, driving proposals, and pitches to win new work while expanding your client network.

By living and working with intelligent technologies, businesses and the humans that drive them will operate at a level far beyond our previous potential. We call this the autonomous age. This will create a paradigm shift for humanity, positively impacting everything from drug discovery to disease management. From the crops we grow, the products we use, to the way we live our lives. To seize this opportunity, we must boldly reinvent our businesses – how we innovate, grow, and lead. Today. At BOI, we are pioneering the field of autonomous innovation - together with the world’s most ambitious businesses. If you are passionate about the intersection of AI and innovation, come join us in our quest to build the future with autonomous innovation.

BOI is seeking an AI Product Manager to spearhead various AI-driven engines. This role involves direct engagement with clients, prospects, and our technology team to identify user needs and lead the build of the products that solve them. You would drive the end-to-end product management of tools that leverage foundational models to create custom-solutions for clients. Experience in the data science and commercial application side of AI is of higher preference than working with machine or deep learning directly. The role is an exciting opportunity for a client-facing PM to flex across data, product, and technology.

Our Team Ethos

Rip Up the Rule Book: We are hungry to challenge the status quo and innovate beyond traditional boundaries. We have strong opinions but still relish a challenge.

Collaborative Leadership: We build on each other’s strengths, and leadership dynamically shifts depending on the timing and topic.

Open and Transparent: We don’t work behind closed doors; instead, we open source our workings as we go.

Technology Forward: We harness cutting-edge AI technologies to drive innovation and create impactful solutions. We are committed to continuous learning and experimentation, ensuring our team is always equipped with the latest AI tools and knowledge to tackle complex challenges and disrupt and redefine industries.

Our work and our partnerships are centered around helping businesses innovate, build, and transform for the autonomous age. We align with clients who are ready to make significant and meaningful changes, not just simple improvements, embodying a spirit that seeks to revolutionize industries and practices with every project.

Ideal Candidate Profile

We're Looking For

Technical expertise: With your background in leading the build and launch of powerful products, you are a subject matter expert on industry-leading products that harness the capabilities of a gen-AI at scale. You have a solid understanding of the technology that goes into building products (whether AI-driven or not) and how data is leveraged to ensure that AI is effective and value-driven.

Preference for data skew: knowledge of tools like Tableau, PowerBI, Looker, Python, or SQL is helpful, in addition to experience with traditional PM tools like JIRA, Confluence or Trello.

Experience in consultancies or agencies is required: this role is an exciting opportunity to work across different sectors, clients, geographies, and business challenges and will require experience in being able to adapt to different client cases. Given our broad client base, candidates without consultancy or agency experience will not be considered for this role.

Previous experience as a product manager: knowledge of code is extremely helpful and we welcome candidates with diverse PM backgrounds that could include experience in strategy, design, client services, or engineering, but this role won’t be the right fit for engineers or other disciplines looking to transition to their first PM role.

An excellent communicator: You can easily translate complex AI capabilities into user-friendly and valuable solutions for our clients businesses.

Strategic Gen-AI Innovator with a Proven Track Record: You have worked on innovations in GenAI and can showcase AI-project implementations through projects, publication, or roles in AI initiatives.

Collaborative Explorer with a Passion for Learning: You are a curious learner with a relentless drive to challenge the status quo and reinvent businesses for an autonomous age. Your collaborative spirit enables you to work effectively in diverse teams, fostering an environment of collective innovation and knowledge sharing.

Entrepreneurial Spirit: You approach your work with an entrepreneurial mindset. You thrive on building trusted relationships and you have a strong empathy for our clients, building an understanding of the biggest opportunities to address their pain points.

What You'll Do

As Part Of Our Team, You Will

Guide the end-to end product vision and strategy: Oversee & own product roadmap and goals and lead the team to build AI-powered products & services. Be an expert on the domain, the market and trends.

Define functional requirements: Develop detailed product specifications and work directly with engineering team to structure sprint-driven roadmaps using agile methodologies

Build partnerships: Work closely with our clients and their engineering & tech teams as well as external stakeholders. Drive clarity and commitment & set high standards for delivering complex AI workloads.

Act as an AI Pioneer: Understand and adapt to various client tech stacks across cloud platforms, front end and back end programming languages, and various integrations (e.g. Snowflake, Databricks, CMS, etc.). Direct experience is preferred, but isn't required, while an ability to establish the technical feasibility of an existing tech stack, identify implications, and suggest alternative solutions if needed will be critical

Guide and Develop Team Skills: Apply technical AI/ ML/MLOps knowledge to enhance the current systems and architecture. Team up with our leaders to enhance skills and confidence of team members, sharing knowledge, giving feedback, and creating learning opportunities.

Grow Client Accounts: Build strategic, profitable long-term relationships, driving proposals, and pitches to win new work while expanding your client network.

Software is eating the world, but AI is eating software. We live in unprecedented times – AI has the potential to exponentially augment human intelligence. As the world adjusts to this new reality, leading tech companies are racing to build LLMs at billion dollar scale, while large enterprises figure out how to add it to their products. To ensure that these models are safe, aligned, and highly useful, they require extremely high quality human-generated data and evaluation. Since before the launch of ChatGPT, through to the latest generation of frontier models coming out today, Scale has been at the forefront of providing the post-training, fine-tuning, and human preference alignment (RLHF) data needed to ensure these models are capable, aligned, and useful via our Generative AI Data Engine. The data we are producing is some of the most important work for how humanity will interact with AI.

As customers train their models on this data, and constantly aim to improve them, a critical need is having trustworthy evaluations of model performance, and an ability to identify weaknesses and potential vulnerabilities. Conducting these evaluations with our human experts constitutes a significant and growing portion of Scale’s work—thus assisting model developers in iteratively understanding where to focus their technical investments.

The GenAI Safety & Evaluation product team at Scale is at the heart of this work, building a world-class customer-facing model evaluation platform. This platform enables customers to easily launch new evaluation workflows, deep dive into evaluation results down to the test case level to understand weaknesses and benchmark performance, and use these insights to drive model development roadmaps. In building this product, you will have a chance to shape the way that models across the industry are evaluated, impacting billions of people around the world. And as a newer product at Scale, you will have the opportunity to build something impactful from the ground up.

As part of the Safety & Evaluation product team, you will partner closely with researchers from Scale’s Safety, Evaluations, and Alignment Lab (SEAL) on productization of novel research, as well as Scale’s expert red team, which supports AI safety via rigorous model testing trusted by the White House, major enterprises, and leading model developers.

We’re looking for entrepreneurial Software Engineers to join our team. In this role, you'll be given the opportunity to build these products and drive millions of dollars in revenue. You’ll also get widespread exposure to the forefront of the AI race as Scale sees it in enterprises, startups, governments, and large tech companies.

The ideal person is a natural entrepreneurial engineer who can take an ambiguous scope and lead the execution of outcomes, doing what it takes to hit them including both backend and frontend coding, defining requirements, coordinating with other eng and operations teams at Scale, etc. We strongly believe the best engineers own outcomes and deeply understand customer problems.

You will:


Own large new areas within our product
Work across backend, frontend, and interacting with LLMs and/or other ML models
Deliver experiments at a high velocity and level of quality to engage our customers
Work across the entire product lifecycle from conceptualization through production
Be able, and willing, to multi-task and learn new technologies quickly
Collaborating with cross-functional teams to define, design, and ship new product features and experiences.
Must be able to commute to the San Francisco Office 1-2x weekly.


Ideally you’d have:


5+ years of full-time engineering experience, post-graduation
Proficiencies in one or more of Python, Node, React, Next.js and MongoDB
Solid background in algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented programming.
Experience scaling products at hyper-growth startups
Excitement to work with AI technologies
Strong written and verbal communication skills
Strong problem-solving skills, and be able to work independently or as part of a team.


Nice to haves:


Strong knowledge of software engineering best practices.
Have experience with AI platforms and technologies, including generative models and LLMs.
Experience building ML infrastructure and AI-powered solutions.

Are you passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and GenerativeAI? Are you passionate about helping customers build solutions leveraging the state-of-the-art AI/ML/GenAI tools on Amazon Web Service (AWS)? Come join us!

At Amazon, we’ve been investing deeply in artificial intelligence for over 20 years, and many of the capabilities customers experience in our products are driven by machine learning. Amazon.com’s recommendations engine is driven by machine learning (ML), as are the paths that optimize robotic picking routes in our fulfillment centers. Our supply chain, forecasting, and capacity planning are also informed by ML algorithms. Alexa is fueled by Natural Language Understanding and Automated Speech Recognition deep learning; as is Prime Air, and the computer vision technology in our new retail experience, Amazon Go. We have thousands of engineers at Amazon committed to machine learning and deep learning, and it’s a big part of our heritage.

Within AWS, we’re focused on bringing that knowledge and capability to customers through three layers of the AI stack: 1) Frameworks and Infrastructure with tools like Apache MxNet and TensorFlow, 2) Machine Learning Platforms such as Amazon SageMaker for data scientists, and, 3) API-driven Services like Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Lex, Amazon Kendra, Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Comprehend, and Amazon Rekognition to quickly add intelligence to applications with simple API calls.

AWS is looking for a Machine Learning Solutions Architect (ML SA), who will be the Subject Matter Expert (SME) for helping customers in the AMERICAS design solutions that leverage our GenAI services, including Amazon Bedrock, Amazon SageMaker, and Amazon Q. As part of the team, you will work closely with customers to enable large-scale use cases, design GenAI pipelines, and drive the adoption of AWS for the AI/ML platforms. You will interact with other SAs in the field, providing guidance on their customer engagements, and you will develop white papers, blogs, reference implementations, and presentations to enable customers to fully leverage GenAI on AWS. Additionally, as the voice of the customer, you will work closely with the service teams, and submit product feature requests to drive the platform forward.

You must have deep technical experience working with technologies related to artificial intelligence, machine learning and/or deep learning. A strong mathematics and statistics background is preferred in addition to experience building complex machine learning models. You will be familiar with the ecosystem of software vendors in the GenAI space, and will leverage this knowledge to help AWS customers in their selection process.

Travel up to 50% across the AMERICAs may be possible.

Key job responsibilities

Working with customers’ development and data science teams to deeply understand their business and technical needs. After understanding their needs, you will design solutions that make the best use of the AWS cloud platform and AWS AI/ML Services including SageMaker, Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Comprehend, Amazon Rekognition, Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Lex, Amazon Personalize, and the other AI/ML services.

Partner with SAs, Sales, Business Development and the AI/ML Service teams to accelerate customer adoption and revenue attainment in the AMERICAS for Amazon SageMaker and related services that support GenAI use cases.

Thought Leadership – Evangelize AWS ML services and share best practices through forums such as AWS blogs, whitepapers, reference architectures and public-speaking events such as AWS Summit, AWS re:Invent, etc.

Act as a technical liaison between customers and the AWS SageMaker or other service teams to provide customer driven product improvement feedback.

Develop and support an AWS internal community of GenAI related subject matter experts in the AMERICAS.
