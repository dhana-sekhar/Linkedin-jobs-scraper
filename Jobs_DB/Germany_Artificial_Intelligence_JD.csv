ECMWF is coordinating the WeatherGenerator Horizon Europe project that will build a European generative foundation model of the Earth system. The WeatherGenerator will serve as a new Digital Twin for Destination Earth. It will be based on representation learning and create a general and versatile machine learning tool that models the dynamics of the Earth system by training on a large variety of Earth system data. The WeatherGenerator will be task-independent and will improve results for a wide range of applications when compared to task specific machine learning tools. It will also be more resilient for climate applications, i.e. when the underlying data distributions are changing. it will lead to a significant reduction in computational costs and faster turnaround times compared to existing tools. The WeatherGenerator will be developed in close cooperation with the team working on ECMWF’s machine learning weather forecast model – the AIFS.

To Build The WeatherGenerator, We Will


Collect and use the most important datasets of Earth system science including data from Digital Twins of Destination Earth, selected observations, analysis and reanalysis datasets, and output of conventional Earth system models.
Build the WeatherGenerator as a novel representation learning-based machine learning tool that trains from petabyte-scale datasets and exploits Europe’s largest supercomputers with training runs with thousands of GPUs.
Engage with the wider weather and climate communities via services and apply the WeatherGenerator for 22 selected applications that can be integrated into the Destination Earth framework. The applications include global and local weather forecasting, local downscaling, data assimilation, model post-processing, and impact applications in the domains of renewable energy, water, health and food.


The project consortium that will build the WeatherGenerator consists of experts in machine learning, supercomputing and Earth system sciences, and includes industry, small and medium-sized enterprises, and leading operational weather centers. The WeatherGenerator will lead to key innovations in weather and climate science as well as machine learning and enable Europe to establish and defend its leadership in Earth system modelling and associated machine learning tooling.

Joining the team, you will have the opportunity to create a cutting-edge machine learning model that pushes what is considered possible both scientifically and computationally. The project will also allow you to make a difference in the world by building a practical model that will help solve challenging, global problems in response to the climate crisis. If successful, the WeatherGenerator will likely be continued as a leading European machine learning tool for weather and climate.

We are hiring four experts in machine learning, dataset generation and high-performance computing to realise this ambitious goal and to help revolutionise machine learning applications in weather and climate science. The successful applicants will form the core team at ECMWF to establish the training data, high-performance computing workflows and machine learning design of the atmosphere component of the WeatherGenerator in close collaboration with the partners. WeatherGenerator will work in close collaboration with other machine learning efforts around AIFS and DestinE, generating synergies and share tools and data wherever possible. This phase of the WeatherGenerator project will run from early 2025 to late in 2028 and future phases are foreseen (subject to funding).

At ECMWF, you will find a passionate community, collectively aiming to build world-leading global Earth system models for numerical weather prediction and climate services.

About ECMWF

The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is a world-leader in weather and environmental forecasting. As an international organisation, we serve our members and the wider community with global weather predictions and data that is critical for understanding and solving the climate crisis. We function as a 24/7 research and operational centre with a focus on medium and long-range predictions, holding one of the largest meteorological data archives in the world. The success of our activities builds on the talent of our scientists and experts, strong partnerships with 35 Member and Co-operating States and the international community, some of the most powerful supercomputers in the world, and the use of innovative technologies and machine learning across our operations. ECMWF is a multi-site organisation, with a main office in Reading, UK, a data centre/supercomputer in Bologna, Italy, and a large presence in Bonn, Germany.

ECMWF is a global leader in machine learning for Earth system application and investigates machine learning throughout the weather forecast value chain including for observation processing, data assimilation, forecasting and post-processing. ECMWF has also developed a machine learned global forecast model – the Artificial Intelligence Forecasting System (AIFS) – that is used for daily weather predictions.

ECMWF has also developed a strong partnership with the European Union and has been entrusted with the implementation and operation of the Destination Earth Initiative and the Climate Change and Atmosphere Monitoring Services of the Copernicus Programme. Other areas of work include High Performance Computing and the development of digital tools that enable ECMWF to extend provision of data and products covering weather, climate, air quality, fire and flood prediction and monitoring.
