Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, 2 Hour Learning. Have you got what it takes?

Are you a skilled full-stack developer with a passion for AI and a drive to transform K-12 education? At 2 Hour Learning, we're leading a revolution in digital learning backed by data and innovation.

At 2 Hour Learning, we don't just aim to improve education—we're redefining it. Our cutting-edge learning ecosystem, powered by advanced AI, learning science, and psychometrics, is twice as effective as traditional schooling. Students at every level, from kindergarten to high school, are achieving remarkable academic milestones, far surpassing standard expectations.

Your Role in the Revolution:

In this role, you’ll be at the forefront of our AI-powered educational transformation. With full autonomy and creative freedom, you’ll envision, develop, and deploy sophisticated full-stack applications and interactive AI tools that not only engage students but also enhance learning efficiency in unprecedented ways.

This is not a position for those who prefer to specialize in a single aspect of development. We're looking for innovative thinkers who can seamlessly integrate AI across both front-end and back-end systems, taking ownership of the entire product. Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology.

Who We're Looking For:

We need bold innovators who thrive on leveraging the latest in generative AI to create real-world educational impact. If you’re excited about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI-driven education and are ready to bring your expertise in full-stack development and AI, this is your chance to make a difference.

Continuous Improvement: Stay ahead of the curve by continually learning and applying the latest advancements in AI and web development to our platform.


What You Won’t Be Doing


Narrow AI Development: You won’t be working on isolated AI features that don’t integrate with the overall product strategy. Your work will have a direct impact on thousands of students.
Surface-Level Coding: This is not a role for those who focus only on either front-end or back-end development. You will be expected to integrate both, creating comprehensive and scalable solutions.
Routine Maintenance: This role is not about maintaining legacy systems or making minor updates. You will be driving innovation and building new, cutting-edge applications.
Waiting for Detailed Specifications: You won't be handed fully fleshed-out requirements. Instead, you will take high-level ideas and translate them into fully developed products, leveraging your expertise in AI and full-stack development.
Working in Isolation: You won't be coding in a vacuum. Collaboration with other developers, product managers, and educational experts is key to ensuring that the solutions you build are impactful and user-centered.
